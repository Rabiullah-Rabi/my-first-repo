<body>
    There are 6 types of headline
    <h1>This is biggest headline. This is known as h1 tag</h1>
    <h2>This is big but smaller than h1. This is known as h2 tag. </h2>
    <h3>This is big but smaller than h1 and h2. This is known as h3 tag. </h3>
    <h4>This Headline is  smaller than h1, h2, h3. This is known as h4 tag. </h4>
    <h5>This Headline is  smaller than h1, h2, h3, h4. This is known as h5 tag.</h5>
    <h6>This Headline is  smaller than h1, h2, h3, h4, h5. This is known as h6 tag.</h6>
    <h7> There is no h7 tag !!! . That's why this texts are in regular size. </h7>

    <p>This is a paragraph. Do you know how I make this word <b>bold</b>  and <strong>strong</strong>? Haha, this is magic of html elements. I can also write <i>italic</i>. Not only <i><b>italic or bold</b></i>. Both can be applied in same text </p>

    <hr>

    <p>Did you noticed something? There is a horizontal line above this paragraph. There is a hr tag above this paragraph. I can break <br> a paragraph or text with br tag.</p>

    <p>Do you know ? if you click on <a href="https://www.google.com/"> google </a> You will redirect to Google.com</p>
    <p>I can set target attribute to anchor tag. So, that external link will open  <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new tab.</a> </p>
